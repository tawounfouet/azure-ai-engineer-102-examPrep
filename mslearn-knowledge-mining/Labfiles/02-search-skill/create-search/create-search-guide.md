## Explanation


1. Variable Assignment:
- Use `=` for assignment without spaces around it.
Replace `set` with direct variable assignment.

2. Echo Statements:

Use `echo` as it is, which works the same way in both Windows batch and Bash scripts.

3. Curl Commands:
- Replace `call curl` with `curl`.

4. Wait Command:
- Replace `timeout /t 3 /nobreak` with `sleep 3`.
