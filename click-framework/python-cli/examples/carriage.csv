27932,J. Bookwalter Vintner's Select Cabernet Sauvignon 1996,,"Columbia Valley, Washington",Red Wine,90.0,"Aged in French, Hungarian, and American Oak barrels, this is a big voluptuous wine made in Bordeaux style that will age for years. 
Aromas of cherry, cedar, cassis, and chocolate, coupled with a velvety finish, give this wine a smooth, mouth filling memory of Cabernet Sauvignon."
