If you're only running a few kilometers, the path should be relatively easy and flat. However, if you choose to run the entire length of the canal, which is over 12km, it may be more challenging.\n",

The scenery along the canal is also quite lovely, with plenty of greenery and water to enjoy. So if you're up for a longer run and want to take in some beautiful views, I would definitely recommend giving the Canal de l'Ourcq a try!\n",
